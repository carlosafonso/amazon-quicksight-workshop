?> **TODO** Include instructions about AWS account setup: standalone and AWS event

To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

- ...attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with the initial environment setup instructions.
